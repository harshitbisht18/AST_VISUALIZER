# AST_VISUALIZER
This project is a simple yet powerful Expression Evaluator and AST Visualizer built using Python. It is specifically designed to help students, educators, and learners understand how expressions are parsed and evaluated in programming.  
When preparing for exams or understanding how compilers parse code, it's often difficult to find simple tools that can instantly generate the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for any expression. Existing tools like Google DevTools or online parsers either:

Only work with full code blocks

Donâ€™t show a clear, tree-based structure

Require programming knowledge or complex setup

This tool solves that problem by allowing you to:

1. Directly input any expression (e.g., a + b * (c - d))

2. Instantly see the AST tree rendered in a clean, visual format

3. Use it for learning, debugging, or exam preparation.
